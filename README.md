blurbox
=======

A blurring input box jQuery plugin

This is how it works:

On click of the element, fade it out into a text-box with contents of the original element.
On blur of the text-box, fade it back into the original element.

Usually it only works with text, but if you have a good idea, pull requests are welcome.
